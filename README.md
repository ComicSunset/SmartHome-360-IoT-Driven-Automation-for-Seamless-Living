# ⚙️ Project Setup

🔑 Prerequisites:
Blynk IoT Account: Create an account on the Blynk IoT platform to connect your mobile app with hardware or simulators.

Picsimlab Simulator: Install the Picsimlab simulator for visualizing and simulating real-time IoT components.

Hardware Setup (Optional): For physical implementation, you'll need an IoT-enabled device (e.g., Arduino or Raspberry Pi) for interacting with sensors and actuators.

# 🔧 Step-by-Step Guide:

📱 Set Up the Blynk IoT App:

Install the Blynk app on your smartphone from Google Play or App Store.

Create a new project in the app and retrieve your Auth Token for cloud communication.

Configure widgets (sliders, buttons, sensors) to remotely control the garden lights, temperature, and water tank.

🖥️ Simulate Devices in Picsimlab:

Use Picsimlab to simulate essential home devices like LED lights, temperature sensors, and valves for water management.

Set up a virtual environment to mirror real-world scenarios and device responses.

💻 Programming & Integration:

Write code for your microcontroller (Arduino/Raspberry Pi) to interface with the Blynk cloud platform.

Implement logic for controlling devices based on sensor data received from the Blynk app (e.g., turning on lights when dark, activating heaters when cold, opening water valves when low).

🧪 Testing & Monitoring:

After setup, test the system by controlling devices through the Blynk app.

Monitor real-time data (e.g., water level, room temperature) and ensure that devices respond as expected based on user commands.

# 🎯 Project Outcomes:

Automated Garden Lights 🌿💡: Remotely controlled or scheduled garden lights that adjust based on user preferences or environmental factors.

Temperature Control System 🌡️: Smart regulation of room temperature by turning heaters or coolers on/off based on sensor inputs.

Water Level Maintainer 💧🌊: Automated management of the water tank’s inlet and outlet valves to maintain optimal water levels.
